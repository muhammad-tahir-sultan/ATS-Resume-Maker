## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Automated PDF Export

This repository includes a professional PDF export automation system using **Puppeteer**.

### Option 1: One-Click Export (Windows)
Simply double-click the `export.bat` file. It uses your local Chrome installation to generate the PDF instantly without any dependencies.

### Option 2: Node.js Export
If you want to customize the export or run it in a development environment:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Export Script**:
   ```bash
   node export.js
   ```
   The result will be saved as `Resume_Export.pdf`.
